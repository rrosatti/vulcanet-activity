Things that might be good to do, if time is allowed.

The items are not in the "Order of Importance".


* Convert code to Python 3
* Add Unit Tests
* Think in a better OOP approach
* Use try/except
* Change the way the calls are handled:
    - Instead of removing/adding the calls on the list,
    maybe it would be better to use statuses, such as:
    ringing, answered, missed and on_queue.
